   7 lines in the dark forest await you during twilight hours. 
   It's the same course as our day zip, but at night you zip away 
   from the platform with no points of reference and fly through the 
   darkness from tree to tree! Feel the speed of a 35 mph ride through 
   the canopy in pitch blackness! This zip is tons of fun as we pump up 
   the tunes and party at night! Illumination is provided. Wind down after 
   the tour with dinner and/or drinks in the beautiful Skamania Lodge. Dress warmly!
